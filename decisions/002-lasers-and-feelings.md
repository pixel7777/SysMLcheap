# ADR-002: Lasers & Feelings as Game System

**Date:** 2026-02-12
**Status:** Accepted

## Context

The app needs a TTRPG mechanical framework to drive the narrative gameplay. It must be simple enough to not overwhelm language learners, genre-agnostic, and work in theater-of-mind (no grid/map needed).

## Decision

Use Lasers & Feelings (by John Harper) as the core game system.

## Rationale

- Single stat on a spectrum (2-5), one die mechanic — minimal cognitive load
- Genre-agnostic: the two poles rename per genre (e.g., "Swords & Sorcery," "Guns & Glamour")
- Narrative resolution, no complex combat rules
- No grid or maps needed — pure theater-of-mind
- Open/free system
- Character creation is fast (one concept, one stat) — perfect for Session 0
- Dice rolls create meaningful narrative forks without complex math

## Consequences

- Limited mechanical depth — may need house rules for long campaigns
- "Number" stat is abstract — need to clearly map it to language-learning implications
- Players who want crunchy mechanics may find it too light (acceptable for our target audience)
