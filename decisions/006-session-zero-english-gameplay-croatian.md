# ADR-006: Session Zero in English, Gameplay in Croatian

**Date:** 2026-02-13
**Status:** Accepted

## Context

TTRPG best practices include a "Session 0" where players establish tone, genre, boundaries, and safety tools (lines & veils). This meta-conversation requires nuance that a beginner Croatian learner cannot express in the target language.

## Decision

- **Session 0** is conducted in English for tone/genre selection and safety setup (lines & veils)
- **Actual gameplay** is conducted in Croatian, calibrated to learner level
- Player can **break character anytime** to enter instructor mode (ask grammar questions, get explanations in English)

## Rationale

- Safety and consent conversations must be fully understood — no language barrier acceptable
- Gameplay in Croatian maximizes immersion and learning
- Instructor mode escape hatch prevents frustration from becoming a barrier to play
- Clean separation between meta-game (English) and game (Croatian)

## Consequences

- UI must clearly distinguish between English meta-mode and Croatian gameplay mode
- AI must be able to switch between DM persona (Croatian) and instructor persona (English) seamlessly
- Session 0 choices must be stored and referenced during Croatian gameplay
