  # ── System of Interest ───────────────────────────────────────────────────
  - id: act_lqs
    name: Language Questing System
    documentation: >
      The system of interest (SOI) — the application under development.
      A software-only, web-based language learning platform that combines
      AI-driven TTRPG gameplay with SRS vocabulary review and progressive
      grammar instruction. All use cases in this model represent uses of
      this system. Maps to the system context block in the logical
      architecture.

    realizedByRefs: []  # TBD — system context block

  # ── Human Actors ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
  - id: act_heidi
    name: Heidi
    documentation: >
      The initial user of the Language Questing System. A native English
      speaker (L1=English) with Croatian as her target language (L2=Croatian).
      Use cases associated with Heidi represent a set of defaults specific
      to her as the first user: language pair, content preferences, genre
      preferences, and learning goals. These defaults are hardcoded for the
      Heidi-only MVP and are intended to later become configurable variables
      populated by application functions that solicit this information from
      the Learner actor.

    status: mvp

    realizedByRefs: []

  - id: act_learner
    name: Learner
    documentation: >
      A paying user of the Language Questing System who may have different
      preferences from Heidi. May have a different native language (L1),
      different target language (though Croatian is the initial supported
      L2), different content tolerances, and different learning goals.
      Learner use cases include all configuration and personalization
      functions that are hardcoded defaults in the Heidi-only MVP.
      No generalization relationship to Heidi — these are distinct actors
      with independently maintained use case associations.

  - id: act_tester
    name: Tester
    documentation: >
      Validates system behavior against requirements. Executes test cases,
      reports defects, and verifies fixes. For the Heidi-only MVP this role
      is performed by Heidi, but the actor is modeled distinctly because the
      concerns (testing vs. learning) are different and drive different use
      cases and interface requirements.

  - id: act_maintainer
    name: Maintainer
    documentation: >
      Administers the deployed Language Questing System. Responsible for
      deployment, updates, monitoring, log review, data management, backup,
      and incident response. For the Heidi-only MVP this role is performed
      by Heidi, but it is modeled distinctly because maintenance activities
      drive their own use cases, requirements, and tooling needs.

  - id: act_security_specialist
    name: Security Specialist
    documentation: >
      Audits and hardens the Language Questing System. Reviews
      authentication, authorization, data protection, and vulnerability
      posture. Not required for the Heidi-only MVP but essential before
      the system accepts payment or stores other users' data.

  # ── External System Actors ──────────────────────────────────────────────
  - id: act_ai_provider
    name: AI Provider
    documentation: >
      An external provider of AI services whose usage is procured for the
      Language Questing System. Accessed via API using a token-based
      authentication model (e.g., Claude API, OpenAI API). This actor
      represents ONLY external API-based AI interactions. AI-driven
      capabilities that are internal to the system (e.g., app-hosted LLMs,
      local inference) are modeled as components of the Language Questing
      System itself, not as interactions with this actor.

  - id: act_host_platform
    name: Host Platform
    documentation: >
      The infrastructure platform where the Language Questing System is
      deployed. Could be a cloud provider (e.g., AWS), a VPS, or another
      hosting solution. Provides compute, storage, networking, and
      potentially managed services (databases, CDN, etc.). The Language
      Questing System is software-only; all hardware and infrastructure
      concerns are delegated to this actor, which negates the need for
      internal hardware components in the SOI model.

  - id: act_payment_provider
    name: Payment Provider
    documentation: >
      An external payment processing service (e.g., Stripe, PayPal) that
      handles monetary transactions for the Language Questing System.
      Manages subscription billing, payment method storage, refunds, and
      transaction records. Required only when the system begins accepting
      paying Learner users.

    status: future

    realizedByRefs: []

  - id: act_advertising_platform
    name: Advertising Platform
    documentation: >
      An external advertising network that serves ads within the Language
      Questing System as a monetization channel. Future-only — represents
      a potential revenue stream alternative or supplement to direct
      user payment.
    ownerRef: pkg_behavioral
    status: future
    useCaseRefs: []  # TBD
    realizedByRefs: []

  - id: act_auth_provider
    name: Authentication Provider
    documentation: >
      An external identity and authentication service (e.g., OAuth provider,
      Auth0, Firebase Auth) that manages user identity, login, and session
      tokens for the Language Questing System. Not required for the
      Heidi-only MVP (simple authentication sufficient) but essential for
      multi-user operation with the Learner actor.
